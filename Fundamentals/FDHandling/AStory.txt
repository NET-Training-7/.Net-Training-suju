 Climate change is having a major impact around the world and there is thus considerable interest in understanding the roles
and responses of microbes in these rapidly changing environments. This virtual special issue highlights recent articles in
FEMS Microbiology Ecology that explore microbes in a changing climate. These articles take us to different biomes across the world, 
with studies charactering microbial responses, metabolic adaptations of microbial communities and their impacts on biogeochemical cycles,
and the effect on symbioses and the interactions of complex microbial assemblages.
